    "## Abstract\n",
    "This project demonstrates key technical skills needed for a data analyst role at Coinbase Internal Audit. I utilized Snowflake (TBD add connector link) SQL to analyze datasets by joining and aggregating provided tables. Additionally, I used Python in Jupyter Notebook with libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, and scatter plots to explore correlations in the data. I also integrated the [CryptoCompare API](https://pypi.org/project/cryptocompare/) to retrieve real-time cryptocurrency prices."
