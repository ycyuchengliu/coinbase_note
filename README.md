# Internal Audit - Data Analytics - Take Home Exam

## Overview
This repository contains all files necessary to answer questions for the Coinbase Data Analyst Take Home Exam. It leverages Python 3 in a Jupyter Notebook environment, SQL for data manipulation in Snowflake, and includes supporting data and outputs.

## Repository Structure

### 1. `00_coinbase_core_hw_notebook.ipynb`
This is the core file that contains the main code to answer the key questions. Written in Python 3, this Jupyter Notebook handles the core logic, data processing, and analysis.

### 2. `01_snowflake_sql.sql`
This file contains a backup of all the SQL queries used in the core code. It provides pure SQL versions of the queries for those who prefer working with SQL directly.

### 3. `02_outputs/`
This directory is used to store all the final outputs generated from the code. It includes results and insights that have been derived from the analysis.

### 4. `03_screenshots/`
This folder contains:
- A screenshot of the table relationship diagram, which outlines how the different tables are connected.
- A screenshot of Snowflake tables after the datasets have been uploaded, providing a visual reference of the data environment.

### 5. `04_historical_price/`
This folder stores the historical cryptocurrency prices, with the files in CSV format. These files serve as input data for the analysis in the notebook.

## Further Assistance
If any part of the logic, code, or structure is unclear, I am more than happy to schedule a walkthrough to explain everything in detail and answer any questions you might have.
