## Automated Control Testing

This section of the repository focuses on automating controls testing in audit projects, specifically for change management processes. The automated scripts help audit teams run full population tests, ensuring that all changes in scope are covered without manual sampling.

### Features:
- Full population testing for change management controls.
- Automated identification of change management records.
- Supports various audit projects with customizable control tests.

### Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the `control-testing` folder.
2. Configure the control tests by updating the `config.yaml` file.
3. Run the automation script using:

    ```bash
    python run_control_tests.py
    ```

4. Review the output for detailed control test results.

## Data Pipeline

This module automates the data transfer from Snowflake to Google Sheets. It is designed to handle large datasets, providing a seamless way to move data for reporting and analysis.

### Features:
- Extract data from Snowflake tables using SQL queries.
- Transform and clean data if necessary.
- Load the data into a specified Google Sheet using the Google Sheets API.

### Setup:
1. Ensure you have access to your Snowflake account and Google Sheets API credentials.
2. Install required Python libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up Snowflake and Google Sheets credentials by updating the `config.py` file.
4. Run the pipeline:

    ```bash
    python data_pipeline.py
    ```
